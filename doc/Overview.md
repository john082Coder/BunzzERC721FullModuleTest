 Implementation of ERC721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, including the Metadata extension. Built to optimize for lower gas during batch mints.


## Features

- Users can mint multiple nfts in a single transaction.
- Assumes that an owner cannot have more than 2^64 - 1 (max value of uint64) of supply.
- Assumes serials are sequentially minted starting at _startTokenId() (defaults to 0, e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3..)

## Use case

The goal of ERC721A is to provide a fully compliant implementation of IERC721 with significant gas savings for minting multiple NFTs in a single transaction.
